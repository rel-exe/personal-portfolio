        I’m <strong>John Russel Regalado</strong>, a Bachelor of Science in
        Information Systems student currently in my third year at{" "}
        <strong>La Verdad Christian College</strong>. I’m driven by the desire
        to create, discover, and leave a quiet mark on the world — through
        design, systems, and thought.

      <h3>Personal Interests</h3>
      <p>
        Beyond academics, I’m drawn to quiet and reflective pursuits —
        <em> reading</em>, <em>writing</em>, <em>poetry</em>, and observing{" "}
        <em>nature</em> (especially mushrooms and cats). I value solitude as a
        place for thinking — where ideas, imagination, and philosophy meet.
